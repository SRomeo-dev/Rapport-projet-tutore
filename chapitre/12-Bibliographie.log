I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.

spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
